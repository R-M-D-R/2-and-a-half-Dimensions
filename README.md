# 2-and-a-half-Dimensions

This was my first attempt to create the effects of 2 1/2-D graphics.

Most people are familiar with 2D graphics. These games are always side scrolling or overhead. Then there's 3D graphics, where you are immersed in a world from the player's perspective.

But 2-1/2D graphics are actually 2D graphics that are made to LOOK like 3D graphics, even though they aren't technically three dimensional. If you've ever played Wolfenstein 3D or DOOM, then you have seen this in action: all of the information is written in 2D, and then the game engine alters the perspective to make it look 3D. It's NOT 3D because you can't move above or below a different level.

This attempt is called "map game," but it's really just a rectangle with a player inside of it. There are three modes: Map Mode, Player Mode, and First-Person Mode. Map Mode is where the overhead map is centered on the screen and the player moves around the screen. Player Mode is also overhead but the player is centered on the screen and the map moves around the player. First-Person Mode is my attempt to have this be, well, a first-person's perspective. It isn't slick, but it works enough for me to make further attempts at this. You toggle between the modes by hitting the TAB key.

Enjoy!
